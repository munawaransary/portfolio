Undergraduate thesis project focused on developing a transcription and translation model for Bangla dialects using transformer-based approaches. Built a pipeline that takes regional dialects of Bangla language and converts them into textual standard Bangla. Explored various tools and models including Whisper, BERT, Bangla T5, and mT5 for low-resource language processing.
